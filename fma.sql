Leg Locks have been employed for longer than their current climb in popularity, yet there is still some stigma around their use, with many techniques being deemed illegal for competition or even considered &lsquo;too dangerous&rsquo; for the training room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;d like to explore this topic a little bit for the benefit of you as the reader and hopefully to reflect some different ways of thinking about Leg Locks within Brazilian Jiu-jitsu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent episode of the ever popular &lt;a href=\'https://youtu.be/qkBXzkD6tis\'&gt;Joe Rogan Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, Joe interviewed Renzo Gracie Black Belt, John Danaher. Many within the Jiu-jitsu &amp;amp; MMA community know Danaher as a sought after coach, mentor and masterful tactician who has been key in bringing the popularity of leg entanglements and leg lock techniques to the fore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/2299/articles/Joe_rogan_John_danaher_1024x1024.jpg?v=1529625644\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rogan and Danaher discussed many intricacies of BJJ at length, including the system of Leg Locks Danaher has introduced to his students&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the interview with Rogan, Danaher references a conversation he had earlier in his jiu-jitsu career with the veteran grappler Dean Lister, who himself was a huge proponent of leg locks. Danaher recalls Lister saying: &ldquo;Why would you ignore fifty percent of the body?&rdquo;, and that it was this question that caused much of Danaher&rsquo;s musings and developments around leg lock and lower body submission systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why would we ignore fifty percent of the body? &lt;strong&gt;Many techniques considered &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu are executed upon the upper half of the body; strangles of the neck, arm locks and even spinal locks, but why has the bottom half of the body been neglected?&lt;/strong&gt; It is worth asking this question. Many have made arguments from a variety of viewpoints, such as rule sets in competition, the relative danger &amp;amp; risk of injury with lower body attacks or otherwise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;It is important to test the validity of any argument; especially ones that discourages learning or the access to new knowledge.&amp;nbsp;This is fundamental critical thinking.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;What would we think if someone had arbitrarily pronounced that chokes were too dangerous for people to use in competition? Would we just ignore the neck of our opponents?&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;The entire art of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is designed around effective and efficient manipulation of an opponent, there should be nothing excluded from that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As someone who has always been encouraged by my coaches to be open-minded, I struggled to understand a lot of the fixed mindsets and dogma I encountered around leg attacks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only time I&rsquo;ve ever seen people injured by leg attacks was out of their own error (such as executing an unsafe escape attempt or by not tapping), never from the pure application of the technique.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;All techniques in Jiu-jitsu are dangerous when applied, that&rsquo;s the whole point!&amp;nbsp;An arm bar is designed to hyper-extend the elbow joint, a lapel choke or rear naked choke is designed to cut off blood supply to the brain&hellip; any given leg attack is no different and should be treated the same.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I do not think that it is sufficient for anyone who is striving to become a proficient grappler to avoid learning the application of any technique or how to protect oneself from any technique.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Every practitioner will favor different approaches to attacking &amp;amp; defending and different styles of practicing Brazilian Jiu-jitsu. Why should we limit those styles?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surely, if we want to see Brazilian Jiu-jitsu stay the seminal grappling art to learn for self defense and combat, we would keep looking to move the art forward and absorb techniques that allow us to reach a greater understanding of what it means to be a grappler.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Personally, I feel a great sense of excitement at the thought of all the new avenues that new techniques open; I see new options for attacks and counters, more defenses and ways to protect myself to employ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess for many practitioners this isn&rsquo;t even really an argument I need to make considering how popular leg locks are becoming. &lt;strong&gt;In my opinion, I think the whole point is to see them simply as just another technique; another technique which we can allow to influence our practice in our pursuit to become better martial artists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oss.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-05-19 04:37:34'),
(25, 1, 19, 'FMA : \'High level problem solving with dire physical consequences\'', '1590892553_SACHAI.png', '&lt;p&gt;Let me first state unequivocally that I am not here to condemn something that does not specifically appeal to me. There are many endeavors in life that I do not find particularly appealing, yet can recognize the inherent value in, while understanding the allure to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, I am not a fan of the seemingly ubiquitous mixed martial arts phenomenon which has enveloped the United States and many parts of the world in all it\'s testosterone fueled glory. The fact that I do not follow the sport does not mean that it doesn\'t interest me in some bizarre fashion, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In asking these questions, I am not attempting to educate myself in an effort to try to become a fan of MMA. It is more from a sociological perspective that I seek to understand the depth of its popularity, and what it means to you, the dedicated fan of mixed-martial arts, or MMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To critics of the sport, it represents little more than a symptom of a sick, depraved society, systematically desensitized to violence and bereft of its once-present moral compass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans of course, see it in a vastly different light. They see a dynamic action spectacle which offers hot-blooded intensity which no other popular sport can even hope to rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, MMA is hardly the first sport of its type to capture the attention of a significant segment of a culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image image-style-side\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://articulatebjj.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/joe.jpg?resize=304%2C166\' alt=\'joe\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of years ago, the Greeks held vicious chariot races, encompassing various forms of violence and often resulting in serious injury or even death. The sport was massively popular in Greece, making its debut in the Olympic Games in 680 BC and surviving well into the period after Greece was conquered by the Romans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chariot racing grew in popularity and importance throughout the reign of the Roman and Byzantine empires. It remained as dangerous as ever, and it was responsible for numerous riots between its supporters and participants, even the first documented reports of sports-centric hooliganism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The violent and dangerous sport survived in Rome until the sixth century AD and in the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, until the 13th century AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another incredibly popular Roman sport, and an ancient pre-cursor to MMA, gladiatorial combat is believed to have originated in the year 264 BCE. Mostly criminals, slaves, or prisoners of war, gladiators engaged in brutal armed combat, often to the death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fighting other condemned men or, at other times, wild animals, the clashes took place in crowded stadiums, in front of wildly enthusiastic groups of spectators. If the fight didn\'t end in death, the fate of the loser was left to the spectators, voting whether or not he lived to fight another day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As ancient societies transitioned into the medieval era, another sport of violent origins grew in popularity across Europe. With the first jousting tournament reportedly occurring in 1066 AD, the combat-based sporting event remained popular throughout the continent until the 17th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jousting was comprised of armored horsemen riding toward each other, thrusting pointed lances into the body of his opponent, in an attempt to knock him from his horse or even kill him. Once off the horse, there were often bouts of further armed combat to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In more modern era, various forms of violence based sport have proven popular to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image image-style-side\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://articulatebjj.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/joe.jpg?resize=304%2C166\' alt=\'joe\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the 20th century, many of our greatest sporting heroes were boxers. Men like Jack Dempsey, Rocky Marciano, Joe Louis, Muhammad Ali, George Foreman, Mike Tyson, and Oscar De la Hoya were some of the most compelling sports icons of the era. The list of prominent boxers who made tremendous sums of money fighting for sport goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the early 1970\'s, martial artist Bruce Lee became an enduring cult figure and an instantly recognizable sports and entertainment icon via his fighting skills and popular film career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask any kid who grew up in the 1980\'s, which athletes they watched most often during their youth, and mixed right in with Joe Montana, Magic Johnson, Daryll Strawberry, or Michael Jordan would be the likes of \'Hulk\' Hogan, \'Rowdy\' Roddy Piper, and Randy \'Macho Man\' Savage. Professional wrestling, in all it\'s choreographed, violent glory, has remained a massive industry and popular attraction to this day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing out of a combination of various fighting styles, hence the name, mixed martial arts, it emerged on the popular scene in the early 1990\'s. Shocking many in its unabashed embrace of seemingly vicious combat, MMA has nonetheless exploded in popularity over the last 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The degree to which it has become accepted as a mainstream sport was really hammered home for me when my mother randomly asked me something about Kimbo Slice a year or two ago. Mom, I had no idea you were a closet MMA fan!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With competing corporate entities, such as Ultimate Fighting Championship and Strikeforce, battling for the prime market shares, even taking their product to network television, the profile of MMA is as high as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former stars, such as Rampage Jackson, are starring in big-budget Hollywood films, and men like Tito Ortiz, who is living out a popular male fantasy by marrying porn-star Jenna Jameson, have thrust themselves into the world of mainstream popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I often wonder what the future holds for the sport. Will we witness a further societal desensitisation toward institutionalized violence? In considering this development, I recall a favorite movie of my childhood, one that took place in a not-so-distant future which now in retrospect appears rather prophetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is likely that in 1987, most people wouldn\'t have considered &lt;i&gt;The Running Man&lt;/i&gt;, the action-adventure set in a dystopian 2019 and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, to be much more than escapist fare, capitalizing on the massive popularity of its star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image image-style-side\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://articulatebjj.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/joe.jpg?resize=304%2C166\' alt=\'joe\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based upon a 1982 novel by Stephen King, &lt;i&gt;The Running Man&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of an American society on the verge of collapse, crumbling both financially and morally, not completely unlike the world we now face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the government has now devolved into a totalitarian regime, it seeks to quiet societal discontent via various popular TV game shows. In the story, The Running Man is one such show, in which convicted criminals are thrust into a labyrinthine environment, pursued to the death by the stars of the show, who happen to be extremely violent, professional killers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to ignore the likenesses to modern American society readily apparent within the story. The financial ruin, obsession with violence, and combination of two of our greatest modern entertainment fixtures, reality TV shows and combat as sport, provide ample food for thought. Could &lt;i&gt;The Running Man&lt;/i&gt; offer a glimpse of where we\'re headed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether we see our lust for violence continue to evolve into a sadistic combination of punishment and entertainment, much like it was in Roman times, or soon witness the birth of a new form of combat-based sport, one thing is certain; our culture\'s love for violence and sports appears undiminished, even 2,300 years after the first gladiators battled to the death in ancient Rome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a novice in the world of MMA, I would love to hear from some aficionados, regarding what the sport means to you.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-05-26 03:35:53'),

It&rsquo;s contagious. Four years before living legend melts into postscript, his team sends him out shopping for his first suit, something tailored and custom to make a good impression for a UFC debut. The scene lives forever on YouTube and is an infectiously funny watch. Two minutes of 24-year-old Jose Aldo strutting around a department store, a giant goofy grin tugging at the burn mark on his left cheek, the poor kid from the favelas tittering at the absurdity around him. He gets measured and fitted. He chooses something simple, something classic. Black on white. Scarface from the very start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He didn&rsquo;t know what was coming, and how could he? He was never meant for the theatrics, the Twitter slights and &lt;a href=\'http://imgur.com/q4aDl9m\'&gt;Photoshop parlor tricks&lt;/a&gt; that bled into a slow McGregorfication of the game. He didn&rsquo;t know how fast eight years could be forgotten, or that he would be painted a liar and a coward while being dragged to the public gallows. He didn&rsquo;t know that before his greatest moment, the world would cling to the words of an Irishman, human sneer wrapped in tricolor parading around with a false belt. No, Aldo knew only that he won. And as long as he kept on winning, life was going to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we&rsquo;re getting ahead of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take it back to 2008. Seven years before the entire city of Dublin turns on him, the greatest featherweight of all-time arrives stateside as a sidebar to a reclamation project. Lion&rsquo;s food for an aging lion. Alexandre Franca Nogueira, on the other hand, is the real story. He is Jose Aldo before there is Jose Aldo &mdash; an overpowering Brazilian who ruled over Shooto for the better part of a decade, gorging on a steady diet of overmatched Japanese fighters. Nogueira&rsquo;s reign is over by the time he lands on the deep undercard of this WEC show, but even then &lsquo;Pequeno&rsquo; is still a name, and names need to feast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They sacrifice the poor kid from the favelas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It ends, mercifully, in eight minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those were the first signs, if you were lucky enough to catch them. If not, there would be plenty more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aldo spends his first year in the public consciousness knocking out five men in varying degrees of outlandish fashion. He devours the WEC champion in his sixth fight, then paints his purple masterpiece on the legs of a legend in his seventh. By the time No. 8 hobbles back home, Aldo is the first man under 155 pounds to ever call himself UFC champion. Twenty-seven prodigious months to catapult an unknown Amazonian talent from sleeping on gym mats to the epicenter of an entire sport. Even Tony Montana himself couldn&rsquo;t pen this script. The kid is right to laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4301381/unnamed.0.jpg\' alt=\'&amp;quot;THE NIGHT WE FACED ALDO.&amp;quot;\'&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lsquo;The Night we faced Aldo.\' &amp;nbsp;Art: Edward Cao.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;His reign rolls into a new era, and his praises are soon sung with exasperation. No champion becomes so vexing, a supreme talent who rarely lays all of his cards on the table, cruise-controlled snoozers sprinkled among snapshots of sublime brilliance. He emerges for two weeks a year then retreats back to Brazil, occasionally remerging as the lone UFC champion to go full Sandor Cleagane and say &lt;a href=\'http://www.mmafighting.com/2015/7/16/8982395/jose-aldo-on-ufc-reebok-kit-we-are-the-power-rangers\'&gt;fuck&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\'http://www.mmafighting.com/2015/3/25/8286553/jose-aldo-i-will-always-complain-that-i-dont-get-paid-enough\'&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\'http://www.mmafighting.com/2015/10/9/9486543/jose-aldo-thinks-a-fighters-union-would-be-great\'&gt;king&lt;/a&gt;. Injuries and arrests and retirements and PED revelations ravage his peers, and he alone thrives. One thousand six hundred seventy-five days and counting. The last man standing from a bygone era of poster curses and Powerman 5000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It really is crazy in retrospect, how high Aldo climbed in such short order and how it&rsquo;s possible he may just be getting started. Even crazier, how stardom was the only opponent to ever duck him during his rise, and now is the very thing sprouting in cartoonish surplus across the Nevada desert. Because UFC 194 was never the biggest event of the year due to Brazilian stoicism. That credit goes to the mouth of the Eire that never stops and never sleeps. Aldo&rsquo;s gangster cool was always just the perfect juxtaposition for the insanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So on Dec. 12, when Irish green and Brazilian gold converge on Las Vegas, the world will at last see what the cult of Mystic Mac can muster. Legends, champions, and journeymen have fallen alike, one by one, before the sword of the greatest featherweight to ever grace the cage. Conor McGregor is the next contender in line, but for now theirs is a brotherhood of fifteen, and this is their story. The story of how each came to learn that when you come at the King, you often leave with a limp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chad Mendes (UFC 142/UFC 179):&lt;/strong&gt; The first time I ever saw Jose Aldo fight, I think it was his first WEC fight. At that time (Urijah) Faber was still at 145 and we&rsquo;d just got done practicing. Someone, I think Faber, put it on and he was like, &lsquo;this is a kid who&rsquo;s going to be tough.&rsquo; Aldo wasn&rsquo;t champ at that time but just watching him fight, we could all tell he was going to be a top guy in the weight class. He was young. Super explosive. Very athletic. He was taking risks with his stand-up and was super aggressive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Faber put it on at the gym, and we all kind of sat there and watched him crush &lsquo;Pequeno&rsquo; Nogueira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexandre Franca Nogueira (WEC 34):&lt;/strong&gt; I first watched Jose fight in an MMA event in a favela called Rio das Pedras, in Rio de Janeiro. I didn&rsquo;t know him personally, we never really spoke to each other before, but I was also there when he lost to Luciano Azevedo at Jungle Fight. I watched him closely, his aggressive style and the holes in his ground game. &hellip; After that I spoke with Luciano and he told me Aldo&rsquo;s boxing had no pressure, that his strongest weapon was his kicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on some of his fights that I had already watched before &mdash; I knew Nova Uniao for a long time, and I always had good results against them &mdash; I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t have much trouble taking him to the ground, that his ground game would be pretty much poor for MMA. I knew everything I needed to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image image-style-side\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4299667/Faber_Finish_copy.0.jpg\' alt=\'https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4299667/Faber_Finish_copy.0.jpg\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Edward Cao&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\'I KNEW RIGHT AWAY, THIS WAS GOING TO BE SOMEONE COMING FOR THE BELT\'&mdash;URIJAH FABER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Urijah Faber (WEC 48):&lt;/strong&gt; I met Jose back in the hotel here in Sacramento when he was on the WEC card when I fought Jens Pulver. I just remember him being a really respectful guy and actually coming up, and him shaking my hand and smiling. We took a picture together. I remember I had seen some of his footage and I was thinking, you know, this guy is going to use this (photo) for motivation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That fight, he beat &lsquo;Pequeno&rsquo; Nogueira. He just put on, like, a &lt;i&gt;brutal&lt;/i&gt; beating. And I knew right away, this was going to be someone coming for the belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Brookins (WEC 36): &lt;/strong&gt;I remember sleeping on [my coach&rsquo;s] couch one day. We were watching WEC. We always watched fights before going to bed, and we saw this kid, Jose Aldo, on the TV. He did this backflip off the cage. At the time I was doing backflips off the cage, and I hadn&rsquo;t been in the WEC but we were trying to get in the WEC. And I told my coach, I remember it on that couch. &lsquo;I bet you, if I go, I&rsquo;m going to fight this kid first.&rsquo; I just had a feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&rsquo;t [see Aldo] until the day of the weigh-ins. I went to go use the treadmill early. Remember, I get up really early. I&rsquo;m always the first one to the treadmill. But that day when I went to use it, he was on the treadmill before me. I was so mad. There was only one treadmill and I was just like, man, this kid&hellip; how did he get &lt;i&gt;up&lt;/i&gt;?! I just got this notion then that he was real, real serious. I don&rsquo;t know why that particular thing did it, him getting on the treadmill before me. I don&rsquo;t know. But this dude, he had it in him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rolando Perez (WEC 38):&lt;/strong&gt; I just knew that Jose was a black belt &mdash; and from what I&rsquo;d heard, he was a good black belt. I saw his fight against [Nogueira] and he pressured, he threw punches and he stopped the guy. So I thought, okay, this could be a good fight for me. I don&rsquo;t go into a fight without having 100-percent confidence. So I went in there like, I could beat this dude. I could outbox him. I could move, I could touch him up, and if I don&rsquo;t stop him, I could beat him by decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Mickle (WEC 39): &lt;/strong&gt;The thing is, I had seen him fight Rolando Perez about a month prior. He beat Rolando in the first round by TKO or something, and I called up my manager and I told him: &lsquo;Dude, I think I can beat this guy. I&rsquo;m so much stronger.&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two days later I got a fax from my manager. They didn&rsquo;t even call me or anything. It just said &lsquo;Jose Aldo&rsquo; on there. I remember thinking, my god, that&rsquo;s&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;fucking&lt;i&gt; awesome&lt;/i&gt;. Then I found out they offered the fight to three other people. All three didn&rsquo;t want it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ricardo Lamas (UFC 169):&lt;/strong&gt; I actually remember the weigh-in (at WEC 39). Jose was right in front of me, and he was just kind of like pacing back and forth. He had his head down, and me and my trainer were kind of sitting there. And we were like, man, this guy is &lt;i&gt;intense&lt;/i&gt;. We knew that he was a tough dude back then and I hadn&rsquo;t even seen him fight yet. I still remember it all the way back then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike Brown (WEC 44):&lt;/strong&gt; One thing that was weird: I distinctly remember noticing at the time, he would never look you in the eye. That was something he did. Now he&rsquo;s starting to with Conor because of this whole thing going on because Conor&rsquo;s so crazy. Conor&rsquo;s getting a pulse out of him. But normally he would never look anyone in the eye. We had to do all these face-offs for promo videos where we had to step to each other, look at each other in the eye, then look at the camera. But he would never, &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt; look me in the eye. He would, like, look off. Look at your ear, you know? I always found that interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now when people tell me, &lsquo;I looked a guy in the eye and I could tell I got him,&rsquo; I always think of Aldo. He didn&rsquo;t look anybody in the eye. He just stared at the floor, came out and fought hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But honestly my confidence was so high. I thought I was going to walk through him. That was just my mindset at the time. I hadn&rsquo;t lost in a while and I was beating guys and I was beating guys easily. There was so much hype behind Urijah. Then it was Leonard Garcia, who had just knocked out Jens, knocked out (Hiroyuki) Takaya. That fight was really easy. So I was thinking, yeah, this is just another one of these guys. Everybody&rsquo;s tough. I didn&rsquo;t see how special he was at the time. But man, I felt it when I was in the cage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perez:&lt;/strong&gt; With Jose Aldo, you don&rsquo;t understand until you experience it. I took the fight on short notice. I only had about two weeks to train, so I didn&rsquo;t really get to train for Jose and what he could do. But in the past I had a buddy I liked to train with. He fought in the WEC too. His name was Ed Ratcliff. Ed was one of the fastest guys I&rsquo;ve ever trained with. Hands and kicks, and he had a karate style so he threw all kinds of spinning kicks and everything. So I was used to speed, because I&rsquo;d seen guys like that. But I never fought anyone with &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; kind of speed and confidence. He fought with more confidence that any other guy I&rsquo;d fought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brown:&lt;/strong&gt; Jose was only [23 years old], but I don&rsquo;t think I ever thought about how young he was. I actually thought he was older. Honestly. I actually remember it now, there was a rumor that people would say: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s bullshit. He&rsquo;s not even that young. He&rsquo;s 28.&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I literally remember hearing stuff like this, and being like, &lsquo;man, you know, maybe he &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;older.&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mickle&lt;/strong&gt;: I knew he would be quick, but he was quicker than I could have possibly thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The different angles he took, you couldn&rsquo;t see his hip movement until his kicks or punches were already there. They were just so fast, and when they did hit you, already two or more were hitting you. So you had to be able to block everywhere instead of just one spot. Most guys, you just have to worry about their left hook or something. But with Jose, you&rsquo;re not worried about his power. You&rsquo;re worried about his speed, because he&rsquo;s going to hit you on the same spot &mdash; or roughly &mdash; at totally different angles. It&rsquo;s six or seven times before the average person hits two or three at most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manny Gamburyan (WEC 51)&lt;/strong&gt;: It&rsquo;s very deceptive. You don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the right hand coming, if it&rsquo;s the uppercut, jab, or it&rsquo;s a crazy right leg kick. He freezes you. It&rsquo;s just the way he fights. It&rsquo;s his timing. He&rsquo;s just one second ahead of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image image-style-side\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4299669/Hominick_Finish_copy.0.jpg\' alt=\'https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4299669/Hominick_Finish_copy.0.jpg\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Hominick (UFC 129)&lt;/strong&gt;: The one thing I felt I was really strong at was distance. Knowing people&rsquo;s distance. Staying out of range or going into range and not getting hit or scoring. And he could close the distance faster than any opponent I&rsquo;ve ever fought. Like, I felt like I was safe, and then &lt;i&gt;boom&lt;/i&gt;, he hit me with a right hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could see it in his leg kicks. He could close distance and a lot of times you didn&rsquo;t see his [kicks] coming because he&rsquo;s so explosive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Edward Cao&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\'LIKE, I FELT LIKE I WAS SAFE, AND THEN &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOOM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, HE HIT ME WITH A RIGHT HAND\'&mdash;MARK HOMINICK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenny Florian (UFC 136):&lt;/strong&gt; It&rsquo;s the beauty of how mixed martial arts is changing the art of striking. In Muay Thai, depending how things are unfolding, your lead leg dictates the amount of strength you&rsquo;re going to get out of your leg kick. Guys will open up that lead leg, then throw that rear leg. What it does, it allows the kick to rotate all the way around but gives the guy who&rsquo;s going to receive the kick a tell. So as soon as you see them open up that foot, you know that kick is coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jose keeps his foot pointed forward and still generates an insane amount of power. So there&rsquo;s no tell. You can&rsquo;t read his kicks, which makes it so difficult when combined with the actual speed he generates. So it&rsquo;s very hard to check those kicks. We saw with Urijah Faber, he was limping for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faber: &lt;/strong&gt;That was actually the most pain I&rsquo;ve ever been in, because it was all soft tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ones that landed, it was a different kind of kick than I&rsquo;d felt before. Normally if you get caught with a kick like that in practice, you stop and, you know, shake it off and get the limp out before you start sparring again. But man, those kicks. We were having a little trouble reaching each other and I think he just decided to use that weapon. And it got nasty, dude. I remember sitting down after the second round having, like, a softball-sized welt right on my knee. I couldn&rsquo;t bend my knee and I just remember looking down like, &lt;i&gt;holy shit.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mendes: &lt;/strong&gt;I fought on that same card, I&rsquo;m almost positive. That was the one here in Sacramento and I think I fought Anthony &lsquo;Cheesesteak&rsquo; Morrison. I took that fight on short notice, but I got to train with Urijah actually quite a bit and prepare. And at the time, Urijah was the man. We had watched Jose and we knew that he was a tough, tough guy, but we didn&rsquo;t really know what the hell was going to happen. And just watching that fight go down, man, that was a tough fight for any of us from Team Alpha Male to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urijah was our leader. He&rsquo;s the guy who recruited us all in and was someone we all looked up to. And he had never really been beat like that before. I remember seeing his leg about two or three days after and it was just&hellip; it looked like somebody took a baseball bat and just hit it &lt;a href=\'http://imgur.com/9EeNzSE\'&gt;over and over and over again&lt;/a&gt;. I remember Faber telling me then: &lsquo;This is the guy who you&rsquo;re going to end up fighting. This is a guy you can beat. I know it.&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faber: &lt;/strong&gt;Looking back, I remember actively having to hobble after him at one point. Like actually having to limp. I was just&hellip; for me it was like, alright, how am I going to hit this guy? So I just switched stances and kept trying to hit him with the right hand. Even when he kicked me to the ground, I can&rsquo;t remember exactly how I went down, but I couldn&rsquo;t bend my leg at all. Like, I really [couldn&rsquo;t] use my leg on the ground either. I felt like I was going to pass out from the pain by the time I did the post-fight interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;ve never been hit with a bat. But I think [that experience] would be kind of like how it feels to get hit with a bat. Like somebody aiming at you with a bat. That&rsquo;s the best way to describe it. Over and over and over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\'TO THIS DAY, MAN, MY KNEE WILL STILL SWELL UP AND HAVE FLUID IN IT. IT STILL HAS CARTILAGE ALL OUT OF PLACE BECAUSE JOSE RIPPED SO MANY OF THE MUSCLES IN MY LEG.\'&mdash;JONATHAN BROOKINS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brookins: &lt;/strong&gt;By the second round I was just, like, almost trying to &lt;i&gt;jump&lt;/i&gt; over those leg kicks. Every time there were coming, I remember being terrified. My god, man. I remember before the fight somebody telling me, &lsquo;Jon, you need to defend the leg kicks. The kid kicks the leg.&rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had only been in &lsquo;x&rsquo; amount of fights and my thoughts on leg kicks, I remember saying: &lsquo;leg kicks don&rsquo;t hurt.&rsquo; That was my response to this guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florian:&lt;/strong&gt; I didn&rsquo;t get full feeling in my legs back for months. He was kicking the inside of my leg, which affected the nerves in my legs so much that it took about a full two months to really get feeling back. It actually [became a game]. I would swipe my hand on the inside of my leg to see if I could feel it, and I just couldn&rsquo;t feel it. I literally could not feel my fingers rubbing against the skin of my leg because the nerves were dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for two months I would just, like, swipe my leg all the time to see if the nerves were there. Finally, after a couple months, they did come back. But, I mean, it was that kind of power. He not only doesn&rsquo;t have a tell to his kicks and generates an insane amount of power, but he&rsquo;s also very fast, and he even keeps the foot pointed. When you keep the foot pointed on a kick, it ensures you want to kick with your shin and not your foot. That&rsquo;s why it really feels like you&rsquo;re getting hit with a baseball bat. He doesn&rsquo;t kick with the foot. He kicks with his shin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brookins: &lt;/strong&gt;It was unbearable pain. I&rsquo;d probably say easily one of the most painful moments of my life was the freaking days after the fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardest weapon in your body that you could throw, if you&rsquo;re throwing it right, would be your shin. At this velocity and speed and projection and all the weight behind it in your leg, that&rsquo;s easily the most damaging weapon if used correctly. And that dude (Aldo) will, like, cut your muscle. He&rsquo;ll cut it to where you&rsquo;ll bleed inside of your leg internally &mdash; to where, to this day, man, my knee will still swell up and have fluid in it. It still has cartilage all out of place because Jose ripped so many of the muscles in my leg. So much blood was draining into my knee after the fight that they kept having to syringe the blood out of my knee for almost two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faber:&lt;/strong&gt; He actually hit me with a jump knee, which &mdash; I didn&rsquo;t feel it until later, but if you watch the fight he hit a jump knee that hit me right in the sternum. It knocked me down for a second then I stood right back up like nothing happened. But after my leg stopped hurting about four weeks after, then my sternum hurt for, like, &lt;i&gt;almost two years&lt;/i&gt;. I&rsquo;m not even sure what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gamburyan&lt;/strong&gt;: I don&rsquo;t know if you guys know anything about soccer, but I am a big-time fan of Brazilian soccer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;England, they&rsquo;re a very fast team. When they play Brazil, somehow Brazil slows them down and makes them play their game. I don&rsquo;t know how it happens, but it&rsquo;s the same thing with Jose Aldo. Even if you want to fight fast, or anything like that, he makes you go on his pace. It&rsquo;s magic, or it&rsquo;s just that he&rsquo;s gifted. I don&rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lamas&lt;/strong&gt;: Jose kind of reads people as they&rsquo;re fighting him. He kind of studies the way that you&rsquo;re moving and what you&rsquo;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not many guys sit back and watch you, the way you move, and study you like that. Not many guys do that at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\'EVEN IF YOU WANT TO FIGHT FAST, OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, HE MAKES YOU GO ON HIS PACE. IT&rsquo;S MAGIC. OR IT&rsquo;S JUST THAT HE&rsquo;S GIFTED.\'&mdash;MANNY GAMBURYAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florian&lt;/strong&gt;: It&rsquo;s these little minute adjustments that he&rsquo;s constantly calibrating with his head and his body that put him in such a great position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His distance control is tremendous. That means that he&rsquo;s just always in a perfect range. If you creep in, he creeps away. If you creep away, he creeps forward. He always puts himself in position to strike but not be taken down, and that really is the art of striking for MMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mendes:&lt;/strong&gt; Up until him, I&rsquo;d pretty much just completely out-horsepowered everybody I&rsquo;d [fought]. Now all of a sudden here was a guy who we were pretty damn even. I remember feeling it. Getting in on his legs and just feeling that explosiveness and that strength and speed, [feeling] someone who was pretty similar to myself. I think that, more than anything, surprised me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florian:&lt;/strong&gt; I hate to talk about it, because I think one of the easiest things to do analysis on is say, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s athletic.&rsquo; Everyone says that. But man, is that fucking kid&lt;i&gt; athletic.&lt;/i&gt; It&rsquo;s just, the speed and power and explosiveness in that kid is on another level. It&rsquo;s one of those things, like we just said, you don&rsquo;t know until you experience it firsthand. He may very well be the best athlete in the UFC. You look at him, he has no wrestling pedigree. But no one can take him down. It&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s doing super technical counters with his wrestling. He&rsquo;s just utilizing his ability to run away from you or to lead your shot, or the ability to limp-leg out with, like, insane&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;speed. It&rsquo;s wild. It really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brown:&lt;/strong&gt; It&rsquo;s his hips. He&rsquo;s got great balance and great hips. That&rsquo;s the term we use in wrestling. The ability to keep your hips squared to the mat and not go over, you know? He&rsquo;s got it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florian: &lt;/strong&gt;I could &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;have hit a better shot against Aldo early on. It literally could not have been quicker or better timed. But he does things that don&rsquo;t make sense.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;I mean, he bounced&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;off that cage. His hip strength, he feels like a middleweight. He really does. It&rsquo;s hard to equate that because I&rsquo;m not sure how much of it was due to my lack of strength in that fight or how much was due to his strength, and I think it&rsquo;s both, but I know when someone feels strong. He really&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;felt&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mendes: &lt;/strong&gt;I can understand because I have the exact same thing. I don&rsquo;t hardly ever get taken down at the gym. It&rsquo;s all about, in wrestling you&rsquo;re taught this at a young age: if you get taken down, you don&rsquo;t let the momentum stop. Once the guy takes you down and he stops the momentum, he has complete control and it&rsquo;s so much harder for you to have to work to try to get back up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that&rsquo;s one of the things that, Jose, he was never a wrestler. Being as athletic as he is and not having that (background), he doesn&rsquo;t want to be on the ground. So as soon as anybody ever takes him down, his goal is to keep momentum going, pop back up and keep going. I pretty much do that same thing. It&rsquo;s just about keeping the ball rolling, and he&rsquo;s just really good at doing that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florian: &lt;/strong&gt;It&rsquo;s also his knowledge of cage wrestling. He&rsquo;s so good at digging his feet into the cage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&rsquo;s like, almost a little mini-moat between the mats and the cage. It dips down. No one talks about that, and it&rsquo;s something a lot of guys now are aware of. A lot of people don&rsquo;t want people to know about that because it is a very strategic thing that guys are using now in fights. It really evens the playing field. There was a time when the cage was a disadvantage for a lot of strikers. Now it becomes an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was one of the first guys to utilize it very well. He sticks his feet inside of that little hole and it&rsquo;s almost impossible to remove his foot from there, because it&rsquo;s grooved. His feet can sit inside that groove and you cannot pull the guy&rsquo;s feet away from that cage, even if you have your hands locked to a certain extent, because it just gets stuck in there. You really have to get good liftoff, and it&rsquo;s hard to kind of get liftoff tied up against the cage. He spreads his legs really far, and he has that foot stance up against the cage. He puts his feet in the groove and he&rsquo;s not going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\'I&rsquo;VE BEEN IN OVER 25 KICKBOXING BOUTS, OVER 30 MMA BOUTS, AND I WOULD SAY THAT&rsquo;S THE HARDEST I&rsquo;VE BEEN HIT.\'&mdash;MARK HOMINICK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lamas: &lt;/strong&gt;It&rsquo;s kind of deceiving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you look at him, he doesn&rsquo;t look like a huge guy. I just think the muscle he has is just very compact, so he&rsquo;s a strong guy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florian:&lt;/strong&gt; It&rsquo;s a special thing. And if you want to get in on his legs, you have to worry about defense, his back knee that he&rsquo;s very well known for and people forget about. Also his uppercuts. He times his uppercuts very well. He throws them very loopy, but he throws them in such a manner that you&rsquo;re going to run right into it if you try to change levels and get in on his legs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hominick:&lt;/strong&gt; It&rsquo;s pure Dutch-style kickboxing. He throws that lead hook then the outside low kick. You look at Pedro Rizzo, Marco Ruas, they come from a long list of top strikers with those combinations, the Dutch style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&rsquo;ve been in over 25 kickboxing bouts, over 30 MMA bouts, and I would say that&rsquo;s the hardest I&rsquo;ve been hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florian:&lt;/strong&gt; He kind of has that ability like Anderson Silva where the more you get nasty, the nastier he gets. He&rsquo;s forced to come up with more tricks, because Jose is content to cruise and do just enough to win. He&rsquo;s that talented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you go in second gear, he&rsquo;ll go in third. If you go in fourth, he&rsquo;ll go in fifth. He does &lt;i&gt;just enough &lt;/i&gt;to get the better of you. And I think that&rsquo;s why he doesn&rsquo;t wow you with stuff. He does nothing you haven&rsquo;t seen before, so in people&rsquo;s minds, it&rsquo;s not, &lsquo;oh my gosh, look at that crazy wheel kick he throws.&rsquo; No, Conor throws those. Aldo, he&rsquo;s throwing leg kicks. He throws a jab. He throws a one-two. He hits you with an uppercut. It&rsquo;s all stuff you&rsquo;ve seen before. But I think it&rsquo;s always in the simplicity, the beautiful execution of simplicity that actually makes him a genius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that you know what&rsquo;s coming and he still gets you with it. He&rsquo;s not a guy who&rsquo;s super creative necessarily, so I think that&rsquo;s why people aren&rsquo;t wowed by it &mdash; he doesn&rsquo;t have the sense of urgency to go out there and risk it. That&rsquo;s frustrating sometimes for people watching Jose Aldo. But you see when he&rsquo;s pressured, when he&rsquo;s forced to show those skills, you see what Aldo is all about. When Cub Swanson ran at him in WEC, he hit that double knee. When Chad Mendes really threw bombs on him and was in his face, we saw what Aldo was capable of. He had to step up his level, so we saw one of the best fights of all-time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\'IF SOMEBODY IS PUSHING HIM, WE SEE HE DOES PUSH BACK. AND WHEN HE TURNS THAT SWITCH ON, HE&rsquo;S ONE OF THE GREATS.\'&mdash;RICARDO LAMAS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4299467/Mendes_Finish.0.jpg\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Edward Cao&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mendes: &lt;/strong&gt;That was something that I&rsquo;ve never experienced before. I don&rsquo;t know if I ever will again. Maybe because it was the first time it&rsquo;s ever happened. But going into that fight I told myself, I made my mind up that this was going to be the most difficult thing I&rsquo;ve ever done in my entire life. I made my mind up that I wasn&rsquo;t going to be afraid. I wasn&rsquo;t going to be afraid of getting tired. I wasn&rsquo;t going to back down. Ever. This was going to be a &lt;i&gt;fight&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faber:&lt;/strong&gt; The most important thing in a fighter is his mentality. Do you really believe that you&rsquo;re the baddest dude on the planet? Because there&rsquo;s a lot of good fighters who are good athletes. There&rsquo;s guys who train hard. There&rsquo;s guys who believe they&rsquo;re real tough. But there&rsquo;s only a certain amount of guys who believe &mdash; like, really &lt;i&gt;believe&lt;/i&gt; &mdash; they should be the champion. I know I have that mentality and I know other guys who have that mentality. And Jose is someone who has that mentality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mendes:&lt;/strong&gt; I talked about it to a lot of people after, especially my coaches, and it blows my mind how&hellip; I mean, I hit that guy with everything I had. There was an uppercut where I faked a shot and threw that thing from the floor, landed it flush on his chin, and the guy just kept coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you can go through something like that, when you&rsquo;re expecting a war and expecting to go through hell, then you do it&hellip; I mean, it sucks that I didn&rsquo;t win, but it proves a lot to yourself that you can do anything you put your mind to. That, more than anything, is why I thought it was so awesome. My mindset was to get in there and get in his face, push the pace and not be afraid of anything. That&rsquo;s basically what I did, and I was able to push him to his limits. I think most people don&rsquo;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\'A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THAT MIKE TYSON MINDSET GOING IN. A LOT OF THE GUYS HE FOUGHT WERE MENTALLY BEAT BEFORE THEY EVEN GOT INTO THE OCTAGON.\'&mdash;CHAD MENDES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lamas: &lt;/strong&gt;That was the biggest mistake I made. Just being in that big of a fight, I think I slowed down a little bit because I really didn&rsquo;t want to make any mistakes he could capitalize on. Bum-rushing him and being real aggressive, I felt that I could&rsquo;ve made a mistake and gotten caught or whatever. But to beat a guy like Aldo, you can&rsquo;t fight like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hominick:&lt;/strong&gt; Here&rsquo;s the thing. We were fighting in the WEC, a smaller network, (with) probably five or 10,000 people in the crowd. Then our first fight in the UFC was live on pay-per-view in front of 55,000 people. So the stakes are higher. There&rsquo;s just so much more at stake and it can definitely change people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mendes:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of the guys he&rsquo;s fought were mentally beat before they even got into the Octagon because he was such a scary, vicious guy. I remember feeling this in wrestling: you get guys who go out there and their whole goal is to just not get pinned. It&rsquo;s pretty tough to pin a guy who&rsquo;s just trying not to get pinned. Even if you completely dominate them, people will look at that match as a boring match. If a guy&rsquo;s not there to fight, it makes it tough. So it&rsquo;s not always going to be entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faber: &lt;/strong&gt;People don&rsquo;t understand because they&rsquo;re not fucking world-class fighters. When you&rsquo;re at world championship level, you&rsquo;re fighting other guys who are at a world championship level. So, you know, Dana White wants to say something? Let&rsquo;s see him get in there and fight. Let&rsquo;s see him fight somebody who&rsquo;s a championship fighter and let&rsquo;s see how many punches he throws in a round. Things change when you&rsquo;re fighting the best guys in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we&rsquo;re dealing with is not a reality-show, fairy-tale world. This is a world where there&rsquo;s high stakes and you&rsquo;ve got guys who have trained their whole life to show they&rsquo;re the baddest dude on the planet. You&rsquo;re fighting other guys who have the same exact lifestyle. The same mentality. The same goal. So I guarantee you he&rsquo;s trying to knock Chad Mendes out. I know he&rsquo;s trying to knock me out. I&rsquo;m a tough dude. Chad&rsquo;s a tough dude. Frankie (Edgar)&rsquo;s a tough dude. That&rsquo;s our game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&rsquo;re in a state of the world where every coward has a voice without any consequences. Everybody can get on the internet, throw out their opinion, and they don&rsquo;t have to walk in front of Jose Aldo and take the risk of being kicked in the head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florian:&lt;/strong&gt; It&rsquo;s hard because Jose doesn&rsquo;t necessarily see the advantage of going for it and risking a loss by being flashy when that belt is everything to him. That means money. That means prestige. That means all of those things. For him to risk it, it means that he could risk losing that belt. So I think there&rsquo;s a tendency of him fighting to keep the belt, as opposed to going out there and winning another world championship. We&rsquo;ve seen that with other guys, and at 145 those opportunities aren&rsquo;t as prevalent as they are with the heavier weight classes for him to make more money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He may have even talked about it in interviews where he says: &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the benefit for me to go out and risk my title? There&rsquo;s a lot of good fighters out there. What do I gain by being more aggressive? I win the fight, I get the same amount of money.&rsquo; But what he doesn&rsquo;t realize is that by being more active and by having that wow factor, it can bring in more money. And it&rsquo;s tough, because he doesn&rsquo;t speak the language. He doesn&rsquo;t speak English, so it might be a little bit more difficult for him to understand that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\'EVERYBODY CAN GET ON THE INTERNET, THROW OUT THEIR OPINION, AND THEY DON&rsquo;T HAVE TO WALK IN FRONT OF JOSE ALDO AND TAKE THE RISK OF BEING KICKED IN THE HEAD.\'&mdash;URIJAH FABER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hominick: &lt;/strong&gt;I don&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;s perceived or how the media treats him in Brazil, but here he&rsquo;s definitely at a disadvantage not being able to speak English because he can&rsquo;t get his point across or how he wants to express himself. Maybe he likes that? It does add to his mystique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florian: &lt;/strong&gt;Anderson (Silva), it took him a while to go out and do interviews in English. Even now, his English isn&rsquo;t great. But Junior dos Santos, he&rsquo;s maybe the best example of it. I felt like he learned English in like three months. It was wild. He knew no English, and then in three months he was using American clich&eacute;s and he doing very fluid interviews in English. It&rsquo;s just like, man, this guy is really sharp. People knew him a lot better and it was such an advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&rsquo;s all part of the economics in MMA. You&rsquo;ve got to be able to speak the language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lamas:&lt;/strong&gt; In Brazil he&rsquo;s a superstar. I think that&rsquo;s all that really matters to him. That&rsquo;s his home. That&rsquo;s his country. Like me, I wouldn&rsquo;t care how people in Europe or wherever perceive me. I&rsquo;m never going to be there so I&rsquo;m never going to be around those people. I&rsquo;m here in America. So I think it hurts him in America or other English speaking countries because the fans don&rsquo;t really get a chance to get to know him, but that&rsquo;s where he&rsquo;s from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&rsquo;s just being true to himself and what he is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gamburyan:&lt;/strong&gt; It&rsquo;s really [just] attitude. It&rsquo;s not like Conor McGregor is better than Jose Aldo. Conor is not even close to having done the things that Jose Aldo has done. It&rsquo;s his attitude that makes him a superstar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Jose Aldo was like Conor McGregor, he would be the biggest superstar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Jose Aldo was like Conor McGregor, he would be the biggest superstar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\'I DON&rsquo;T THINK CONOR IS DOING IT TO RILE ANYONE UP. IT&rsquo;S NOT THAT HE&rsquo;S TRYING TO GET PAID. HE REALLY BELIEVES THAT SHIT.\'&mdash;URIJAH FABER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4299361/McGregor2_Finish_copy.0.jpg\' alt=\'https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4299361/McGregor2_Finish_copy.0.jpg\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Edward Cao&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hominick:&lt;/strong&gt; You&rsquo;ve almost got to appreciate what Conor McGregor does, because it takes some guts to get in someone&rsquo;s face and say the things he does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florian: &lt;/strong&gt;What he has done in such a short amount of time is unlike anything we have seen. Here is this dynamo, this trash-talking star who needs to be put in his place. Now, win or lose, Conor McGregor is absolutely [the rival] to define Jose&rsquo;s legacy. Jose Aldo is in the top two or three guys of all-time pound-for-pound, and you look at what he&rsquo;s done, the competition he&rsquo;s faced &hellip; that&rsquo;s crazy to think about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faber: &lt;/strong&gt;Conor has an age and accomplishment level where he could do something completely wrong and he&rsquo;d believe in it, you know? That&rsquo;s a powerful thing. It&rsquo;s almost like ignorance is bliss. That could also be trouble for him, and I say that because the first week we sat down and had a conversation &mdash; of course he&rsquo;s always just talking shit, but he says he dominated the (Mendes) fight from the beginning of the bell to the end of the bell. Now, I don&rsquo;t know if he really believes that. But if he does, he didn&rsquo;t see the fucking holes that everyone else did. That in itself &mdash; a little delusion &mdash; can be something that affects you, if you don&rsquo;t recognize the weaknesses. But I think that he&rsquo;s smarter than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one thing I would say about him, too, his ability to hurt people &mdash; Chad was so tired and had his hands dropped, but the power is one thing that you can&rsquo;t deny. Conor is fucking&lt;i&gt; massive&lt;/i&gt; for that weight class. You can see when he and I are standing next to each other. I weighed 164 on [The Ultimate Fighter] and he&rsquo;s fucking way bigger than I am. He&rsquo;s fighting 145, so he had to be in the 170s, I would think. That&rsquo;s a big motherfucker, man. And he&rsquo;s got a big old fucking head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florian:&lt;/strong&gt; What I was hearing leading up to [UFC 189] &mdash; and I picked Chad basically because of it &mdash; was that Conor&rsquo;s knee was like, &lsquo;hanging on by a string.&rsquo; That was one of the quotes I heard, that apparently he was training with Rory MacDonald in Toronto and had hurt it pretty bad, and got rushed to get an MRI. Apparently he thought for sure it was torn, his ACL. So that had me nervous. He really wasn&rsquo;t able to train like he should have, and it just told me a lot about Conor, about how freaking dedicated and how determined he is as a fighter, both in and out of the cage. Then you couple that with everything he had to do? His responsibilities. On fight week he&rsquo;s flying to Connecticut to do an interview with ESPN. I mean, there are no fighters who would do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So a lot of people say, &lsquo;this Conor guy, he&rsquo;s all talk; he&rsquo;s not the real deal. Who has he beaten?&rsquo; A lot of people are still blinded by this hate for him. But the reality is, this guy is an unbelievable fighter. I think we&rsquo;ll look back on Conor McGregor&rsquo;s style as a style that will revolutionize MMA striking as we know it. I really believe that. The things he&rsquo;s doing are phenomenal, and now there is a lot of pressure on Jose Aldo to [win for the pride of Brazil]. Now, is it fair? Is it right? No. Jose is in a tough spot, and I&rsquo;m sure there are a lot of Brazilians and a lot of people on his team there are maybe adding to that as well, saying you&rsquo;ve got to beat this guy who has been talking trash about us for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image image-style-side\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4299643/McGregor_Finish.0.jpg\' alt=\'https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4299643/McGregor_Finish.0.jpg\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Edward Cao&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\'I THINK WE&rsquo;LL LOOK BACK ON CONOR MCGREGOR&rsquo;S STYLE AS A STYLE THAT WILL REVOLUTIONIZE MMA STRIKING\'&mdash;KENNY FLORIAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faber: &lt;/strong&gt;I always talk shit to [Conor] because he tapped to a kneebar and he tapped to a choke, so it&rsquo;s not like he hasn&rsquo;t lost before. Obviously he made some leaps and bounds from there. But the most successful people deflect a loss, or deflect something that doesn&rsquo;t go their way, and find &mdash; not an excuse necessarily, but a reason why they lost. The guys who come back and fix those things usually really stand out, and I don&rsquo;t take him as a guy who&rsquo;s going to get deflated. But he&rsquo;s lost before. People forget he really did fucking tap to a kneebar. I mean, you know I wouldn&rsquo;t fucking tap to a kneebar. You know Frankie Edgar wouldn&rsquo;t tap to a kneebar. He&rsquo;s lost before. It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s a mythical thing for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mickle:&lt;/strong&gt; Honestly I don&rsquo;t think Conor stands a chance against Jose. Not by any means, and I&rsquo;m going to put a lot of money on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People overthink things. It&rsquo;s not like this is new for Aldo. What was it, his sixth fight in the WEC that he won the title? He&rsquo;s had it for so long. All he&rsquo;s going to do is be a smarter fighter, win at least three rounds. And really, I just hope he TKOs or knocks out McGregor, just so he can pretty much say, hey dude, good job talking all that shit and not being able to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Florian: &lt;/strong&gt;I do like the way Conor matches up with Jose. We learned something about him (in the Mendes fight) that we didn&rsquo;t really know before, that this isn&rsquo;t a guy who if he runs into trouble against Jose Aldo is going to fold. It&rsquo;s just not going to happen. He found himself in some bad positions, he stayed extremely calm and just showed a chin from hell. He seemed completely unfazed. It was just like he knew nothing was going to stop him that night. It didn&rsquo;t matter who it was or what it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every great fighter, every great athlete needs a rival. And for [Jose Aldo], Conor McGregor is that rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mendes: &lt;/strong&gt;What sucks is that say something happens, Jose gets caught and knocked out? Everyone is going to just (jump to the conclusion), &lsquo;oh, Conor was in his head, he let it get to him.&rsquo; But shit happens. There&rsquo;s four-ounce gloves, anything could happen at any time. You don&rsquo;t become a world-class athlete, world champion, and not have the ability to control your emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lamas:&lt;/strong&gt; Unfortunately in this sport, the fans only see you as good as your last performance. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, all the great accomplishments you&rsquo;ve done in the past. If you lose a fight then all of a sudden you suck. Not all the fans are like that, but a lot of them are because we have a lot of fans who aren&rsquo;t&hellip; I wouldn&rsquo;t say very educated on the sport or the fighters. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jose Aldo is the best featherweight champion in UFC history. He&rsquo;s the only featherweight champion in UFC history. He&rsquo;s managed to hold onto that belt for a long time. That, in and of itself, is a huge accomplishment in the sport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brookins:&lt;/strong&gt; I was always rooting for him. Some of his fights after ours, I&rsquo;m just crazy impressed, almost like I know it&rsquo;s destiny. He&rsquo;s got it, man. He&rsquo;s just got that connection. Like, whatever that is, this is what&rsquo;s been set out for him. I always felt kind of lucky enough in my path to have been involved with that process, not just as a loser but as a part of my own story as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&rsquo;s wild to see what fighters end up doing, but for him, he&rsquo;s just such a good, genuine guy, I hope what he&rsquo;s remembered for is something outstanding. I always felt that I had the craftiness to have what it takes, but I just didn&rsquo;t have, like&hellip; what he knows on the inside. What he feels, his belief system, all that stuff &mdash; it&rsquo;s just, you can&rsquo;t teach that stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\'JOSE ALDO IS THE BEST FEATHERWEIGHT CHAMPION IN UFC HISTORY. HE&rsquo;S THE ONLY FEATHERWEIGHT CHAMPION IN UFC HISTORY. THAT, IN AND OF ITSELF, IS A HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT IN THE SPORT.\'&mdash;RICARDO LAMAS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faber: &lt;/strong&gt;I hold myself in pretty high regard. So the fact that he beat the crap out of me says a lot about him. And I hold Chad Mendes in that regard, and Frankie Edgar. We&rsquo;re in a time where it&rsquo;s hard to sit back and smell the roses. I don&rsquo;t think many guys are really thinking about what their own impacts are, or where they sit in the whole history of things. It&rsquo;s hard for people to say anything like that right now because we&rsquo;re all in our doing stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down the road, there will be specials talking about the best fighters and epic fights and epic battles and stuff like that. But at a time when the sport is at it&rsquo;s best, when every month there&rsquo;s a new [big deal], Jose Aldo is a world champion, and he&rsquo;s beaten guys who have at times been the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He doesn&rsquo;t go above and beyond to do P.R. and do all of those things. He doesn&rsquo;t go to the UFC&rsquo;s beck and call, and has actually talked against them. When it comes to people who will continue to be promoted after they&rsquo;re the champion &hellip; that&rsquo;s one thing that, will you hear a ton about Aldo regardless? Maybe not a ton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as a fight fan, that&rsquo;s not what makes your legacy &mdash; how popular you are. It&rsquo;s what kind of fighter you were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Jose Aldo is always going to have a place as one of the greatest, because the guy is a fucking maniac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Frankie Edgar and Cub Swanson declined to be interviewed for this story. Alexandre Franca Nogueira spoke to MMAFighting.com&rsquo;s Guilherme Cruz. Chan Sung Jung was unable to be reached due to military commitments.

(28, 1, 19, 'Fake martial arts: The psychology behind \'no-touch\' knockouts', '1590946652_ipman4finale.jpg', '&lt;p&gt;What leads people to believe in \'chi\' attacks and \'no-touch\' knockouts? A small fraction of martial arts teachers claim to possess extraordinary powers, like being able to knock out opponents without touching them. A recent video essay explores the psychological factors that drive people to believe in fake martial arts. These factors might also help to explain why there\'s often some degree of blind self-deception regarding the efficacy of traditional martial arts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of traditional martial arts lies a strange world where energy attacks and \'no-touch\' knockouts replace punches and kicks. You can get a glimpse of it through YouTube videos showing fights that more closely resemble \'Dragon Ball Z\' than real-life combat. Take, for example, practitioners of the Balinese martial art Yellow Bamboo, who believe they can blast their opponents with God-charged beams of \'chi\' (it &lt;a href=\'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1ykNZ7rAcw\'&gt;doesn\'t fare well&lt;/a&gt; against non-believers). Or George Dillman, the \'no-touch\' master who seems to have convinced dozens of his students that he could &lt;a href=\'https://youtu.be/kIL5nD2PQ0Y\'&gt;knock down &mdash; and even knock out &mdash; opponents without touching them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=\'media\'&gt;&lt;oembed url=\'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JtmCTSrqTg\'&gt;&lt;/oembed&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there\'s Yanagi Ryuken, a Japanese man who claims to have psychic abilities, and has been &lt;a href=\'https://thesanghakommune.org/2017/03/07/the-curious-case-of-yanagi-ryuken-2006/\'&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as a master of Daito Ryu Aikido. Here he is deftly defeating a flock of his students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=\'media\'&gt;&lt;oembed url=\'https://youtu.be/mdUxPLIJVgI\'&gt;&lt;/oembed&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Ryuken, who was 65 at the time, accepted a challenge match against 35-year-old Iwakura Tsuyoshi, a Japanese journalist and mixed martial artist. Here\'s what happened:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=\'media\'&gt;&lt;oembed url=\'https://youtu.be/7jf3Gc2a0_8\'&gt;&lt;/oembed&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryuken said he lost because his psychic abilities were temporarily weakened due to illness. It\'s impossible to know whether Ryuken\'s faith in his own psychic abilities was pummelled that day, but he &lt;a href=\'https://thesanghakommune.org/2017/03/07/the-curious-case-of-yanagi-ryuken-2006/\'&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; continued to train students in his special style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any case, it\'s a brutal sight. It also highlights the darker, not-so-funny side of fake martial arts: people looking to defend themselves are being sold shoddy techniques that fail in real-world fights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why do people buy into fake martial arts?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent video essay, YouTuber &lt;a href=\'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtGoikgbxP4F3rgI9PldI9g\'&gt;Super Eyepatch Wolf&lt;/a&gt; explores that question by taking a look at the history of fake martial arts, and some of its noted \'masters.\'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=\'media\'&gt;&lt;oembed url=\'https://youtu.be/gjbSCEhmjJA\'&gt;&lt;/oembed&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 30-minute video is well worth a watch. If nothing else, check out the last segment, which outlines the story of &lt;a href=\'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Xiaodong\'&gt;Xu Xiaodong&lt;/a&gt;, a Chinese mixed martial artist who\'s spent years challenging and defeating fake martial arts teachers. In response, the Chinese government lowered his \'social credit\' score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtGoikgbxP4F3rgI9PldI9g\'&gt;Super Eyepatch Wolf&lt;/a&gt; notes that fake martial arts groups are similar to cults, in that both promise \'simple human comfort\' and protection from fear. In the case of martial arts, that fear is physical violence from others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\'This was the same psychological manipulation that let Charles Manson control his followers, making them act in strange, bizarre ways, and even commit murder,\' Wolf says, noting that the same promise of comfort and community also enabled members of the Heaven\'s Gate cult to commit mass suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to cult leaders and \'no touch\' masters are so-called \'faith healers,\' like &lt;a href=\'https://youtu.be/xdUIqKJyD0Q\'&gt;Benny Hinn&lt;/a&gt;. With all three, Wolf notes, the formula boils down to: \'Put all your faith into this one individual, and they will give you the means to guard yourself from the evils of this world.\'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\'...there\'s a tremendous amount of comfort in that, the idea that these people can teach you techniques that will make you immune from physical danger, creating an illusion so strong, it\'s led to these kinds of footage we\'ve been looking at...\'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about traditional martial arts? Might a similar, yet subtler, form of self-deception about the true strength of students\' or teachers\' abilities also occur in, say, karate or Wing Chun dojos?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2012 &lt;a href=\'https://samharris.org/the-pleasures-of-drowning/\'&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, neuroscientist and author Sam Harris suggests two ways that mainstream martial artists come to delude themselves regarding their abilities. One is that training occurs in a controlled, predictable environment, and so learned techniques can become a \'mere pantomime of combat that does little to prepare a person for real encounters with violence.\' Also, some techniques are too dangerous to perform in a dojo, so practitioners just assume that they\'d be effective in a real fight, even though \'reports from the real world suggest otherwise.\'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An even deeper dive into self-delusion in the martial arts comes from a &lt;a href=\'https://gilliankrussell.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/epistemicviciousness.pdf\'&gt;2010 paper&lt;/a&gt; written by Gillian Russell, a philosophy professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Russell\'s key argument is that martial arts tend to encourage \'epistemic viciousness,\' which she defines as the \'the possession of vices that make one bad at acquiring true beliefs, or give one a tendency to form false ones.\'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To summarize, Russell describes several factors that might encourage bad beliefs among martial artists, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dojo acts like a church.&lt;/strong&gt; For example: Members feel guilty if they don\'t go; social norms and dress codes are moralized; practitioners treat the art as sacred, unquestionable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem of investment.&lt;/strong&gt; Both teachers and students often invest a lot of time and resources into one specific practice. This investment makes them less likely to entertain evidence that their specific techniques might not be effective, or that there might be another martial art that is superior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Students must rely on a teacher.&lt;/strong&gt; It\'s impossible to learn martial arts online or from a book; students need an authority to teach them. This inevitably means there will be a period during which students can\'t accurately judge whether their teacher is teaching effective (or safe) techniques. Also, most martial arts are hierarchical, requiring students to show deference to teachers and senior members. This submission may cause students to put more stock into certain beliefs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The art appeals to history and tradition.&lt;/strong&gt; \'Just as there is a tendency to defer to seniority in the martial arts, so there is a tendency to defer to history,\' Russell writes. She notes that many martial arts promote too much \'epistemic deference\' to old teachings, while being unwilling to incorporate new techniques or information. She then draws a comparison: \'If you tell a long-distance runner that Pheidippides, the original marathon-runner, said that athletes should not spend time thinking about their equipment, but should focus their minds on the gods, he might say something like \'oh yes, that\'s interesting\' but he wouldn\'t infer that he should stop replacing his running shoes every 400 miles. Runners think that the contemporary staff of Runner\'s World know more about running than all the ancient Greeks put together.\'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, traditional martial arts can provide people with real self-defense skills, discipline, and a sense of aesthetic beauty and community. But martial arts also illustrate how blind spots can cloud judgement. After all, the physical, mental and emotional stakes are high in martial arts, not to mention that martial artists invest tons of time and money into training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these conditions may make people more vulnerable to cognitive biases: Practitioners want to believe what they\'re doing is effective, that they\'ll be protected from outside threats, and that their community is on the right path, even if evidence says otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, blind spots aren\'t limited to martial arts. As Russell notes, you can see similar phenomena in a parent who thinks her kid is an unrecognized genius, or in spouses who wildly overestimate how attractive strangers would rate their husband or wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\'The last case, in particular, might tempt us to think that some epistemic vices are sort of cute. But it would be stupid to believe that epistemic vice is acceptable in the martial arts, since this is an area where it is morally important to have true beliefs, and not just cute ones,\' Russell writes. \'The question of whether you can stop a train with your ki, or whether a stretch will be detrimental to your students\' health, or whether a technique could kill someone&mdash;these are not questions on which you should want to be endearingly mistaken.\'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-05-30 18:37:32'),
(29, 1, 19, 'Top 10 most iconic martial arts fighters of all time', '1591141998_Ali.jpeg.jpg', '&lt;p&gt;They&rsquo;re the men you don&rsquo;t wanna meet in the ring or on the street. Welcome to WatchMojo.com, and today we&rsquo;re counting down our picks for the top 10 fighters of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this list, we&rsquo;ve chosen the best professional combat fighters from all walks of life, and have ranked them based on accomplishments, skill and the likelihood that they could kick anyone&rsquo;s ass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;#10: Roy Jones, Jr.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Pr-YGWaYRsgQPk5PyV2ZbnNMQhIJ0c4aBjZTXg0cIJwd02eCf4eLYKq_lDnS0XxW0pEkGaLbg_x25x4iGaJh9R63zR__b3VIunGdkqUJuqNU860UiluG0tI\' alt=\'ROY JONES JR READY TO BID FAREWELL TO BOXING -\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Named the Boxing Writers Association of America&rsquo;s Fighter of the Decade for the &lsquo;90s, Jones was the first boxer to go from light-middleweight to a heavyweight title. To start his career, he went 34 bouts without losing &ndash; and even then, his first defeat was controversial. With an original style and granite chin, Jones set a record by holding seven belts simultaneously. Though his dominance declined, Jones&rsquo; legacy was secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;#9: Fedor Emelianenko&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://c4.wallpaperflare.com/wallpaper/852/678/492/sports-mixed-martial-arts-fedor-emelianenko-mixed-martial-artist-wallpaper-preview.jpg\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you earn the nickname The Last Emperor? Try going undefeated for almost a decade. Longevity was his greatest asset, as was intensity, stoicism and unpredictability. This Russian heavyweight was a tough guy to knock-out &ndash; or even to dominate. Some say he benefited from easier opponents by fighting for PRIDE-FC, M1 Global and Affliction rather than UFC; but in his prime, Emelianenko was unquestionably king &ndash; retiring with 35 wins in 40 contests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;#8: Manny Pacquiao&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://cdn.wallpapersafari.com/55/89/fahdoO.jpg\' alt=\'Manny Pacquiao Background Hd Wallpaper for Desktop and Mobiles 1080x1920\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&rsquo;s the biggest name in the game today. Labeled Fighter of the Decade for the 2000s, Pac-Man became the first octuple boxing champion, with ten world-titles across eight weight divisions. After starting his career in 1995, this Filipino fighter rocketed through weight classes like no one before or since, mastering fancy footwork with a stringent work ethic, and eventually becoming one of the world&rsquo;s most electrifying and highest-paid athletes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;#7: Georges St-Pierre&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/BXMyOeeU_WJoZalXwNGtvPu7pEDdDF-uea1rD5zvqkZfg9P15H84GAR_rZoaDY4OTrzdLsJ3G_RWcJGsFb8n-oIEaVTFW4KDRX2IXZeSOPw83Jq434-l\' alt=\'Georges St-Pierre officially signs new contract with UFC\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This welterweight has the brains, brute strength and discipline to succeed in the octagon, plus he&rsquo;s a great MMA ambassador. GSP&rsquo;s got a solid martial-arts background, with karate, boxing, jiu-jitsu, wrestling and Muay Thai capping off his skills and making him a well-rounded fighter. Also known as one of the biggest UFC pay-per-view draws, the man known as Rush is still riding a career high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;#6: Mike Tyson&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://wallpapercave.com/wp/b0Wi4bG.jpg\' alt=\'Mike Tyson Wallpapers - Wallpaper Cave\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the undisputed world heavyweight champion, Iron Mike claimed victory his first 19 professional fights &ndash; all by KO. As the youngest boxer to hold titles like the WBC, WBA and IBF heavyweight belts, the Baddest Man on the Planet was dominant and dreaded in the &lsquo;80s and &lsquo;90s, and could possibly have taken any guy on this list in his prime. How&rsquo;d he win so much? He fought dirty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;#5: Muhammad Ali&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://dujye7n3e5wjl.cloudfront.net/photographs/1080-tall/time-100-influential-photos-neil-leifer-muhammad-ali-vs-sonny-liston-56.jpg\' alt=\'Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston | 100 Photographs | The Most ...\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was The Greatest, and as much a personality as he was a fighter: Ali persistently trash-talked rivals, and stood up for his beliefs. In the ring, this heavyweight used his height, footwork, speedy fists and Rope-A-Dope technique to triumph. An Olympic gold medalist and three-time world champ, he ended his career with 56 wins in 61 fights. And even when people called him over-the-hill, Ali surprised them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;#4: Joe Louis&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://www.mackinac.org/media/images/1997/vpt97-07a.gif\' alt=\'Joe Louis vs. the IRS &ndash; Mackinac Center\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known as one of the greatest heavyweights to ever step between the ropes, the Brown Bomber brought the sport of boxing back from low-point with his track-record of industriousness, authenticity and powerful punching. He defended his championship title 25-times over 140 consecutive months, to retire with 66 wins in 70 fights, 52 coming by KO. An American icon, he also represented U.S. athletic dominance and the fight for integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;#3: john jones&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/002/511/328/hi-res-6200018_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&amp;amp;h=1200&amp;amp;q=75\' alt=\'UFC 165 Primer: Jon Jones and the 3 Best Elbows in MMA Right Now ...\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be that the only reason Jones hasn\'t sat atop this list every day for the past eight&amp;nbsp;years or so has been his out-of-cage transgressions&amp;nbsp;that got him into trouble on multiple occasions with multiple legal and non-legal organizations. When he\'s fighting, he\'s the best and it\'s unquestioned. He\'s fought four times since December 2018, beginning with a third-round stoppage of Alexander Gustaffson. Jones&amp;nbsp;proved it again at UFC 235 by completely shutting down any attempt at offense by Anthony Smith. He then won a split decision over Thiago Santos at UFC 239 on July 6 and beat Dominick Reyes in February 2020. Jones frequently teases a move up to heavyweight, but will it ever happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;#2: Anderson Silva&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EMphw6lVAAEQtS-.jpg\' alt=\'MMAFighting.com on Twitter: &amp;quot;February 5, 2011 &mdash; Anderson Silva ...\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spider holds the UFC record for longest title defense streak, and even UFC prez Dana White called this Brazilian the best mixed-martial artist ever. Known mainly for his Muay Thai skills, he&rsquo;s also got black belts in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Judo among his many ranks. Labeled one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in history, he wins fights by knockouts, submissions, intimidation and any other way he can &ndash; which sometimes gets him in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;#1: Sugar Ray Robinson&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=\'image\'&gt;&lt;img src=\'https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ODDdNiUv8ek/maxresdefault.jpg\' alt=\'Sugar Ray Robinson - Amazing Combinations - YouTube\'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cited by many as history&rsquo;s greatest boxer, Robinson is the man for whom the pound-for-pound rankings were created. Sugar Ray met the fiercest competition going and simply accomplished more than anyone else on this list, with 173 wins in 200 fights, 108 by knock-out. His looks, charm and showmanship blended with speed, footwork, a rock-hard chin and ambidextrous KO skills to ensure that Sugar Ray was the total package.&lt;/p&gt;', 1, '2020-06-03 00:53:18'),
