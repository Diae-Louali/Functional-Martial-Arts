<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This blog is a CRUD project is my first introduction to the world of programming. The website and all of it's data is dynamically loaded with a Php backend, MySQL database and Javascript/JQuery Front end as well as an extensive focus on CSS and UI design. 

**The Blog contains** :  

  - Home Page (with a search filter for the articles)
  - Login Page
  - Register Page
  - Profile Page
  - Articles Single Page
  - Advanced Comment-Reply System (inspired by reddit. This was my first introduction to recursivity)
  - About Page
  - Dashboard Page : Funny Story --> I was unware of single page applications at the time so i thought the speed of navigation was done by using Javascript Tabs. I'll let you discover the result of that by yourself by visiting the AdminFMA.php page
